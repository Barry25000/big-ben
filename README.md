## Description
  A simple e-commerce website built using React, Redux, Node, Express and MongoDB.

For the front end, we plan on using Semantic UI.

For the back end, we plan on using Node, Express and MongoDB along with GraphQL.

We will also be creating test cases using Jest and Enzyme.

The site will be deployed on Heroku.

## Feature List

- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Option to add, edit, view and delete all the items in our store.
- Option to add items or remove items from the cart.
- Display the total bill of the cart and update it as soon as the user updates the cart.
- Using Local Storage to store the JWT so that we only allow logged-in users to buy items.
- Option to pay and checkout, thus creating an order and emptying the cart.
